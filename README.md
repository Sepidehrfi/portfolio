## What's included?

- All the components from [UI Thing](https://ui-thing.behonbaker.com/getting-started/introduction).
  - So this may impact performance. I'm not sure. I would recommend that you delete the components that you do not need.
- All the components from [Inspire UI](https://inspira-ui.com/).
  - Just copy component code into components => Inspire folder, and if there is any cn function import, remove it.
- Dark Mode.
- Theme Costomizer.
- i18n.
- State Manage(Pinia).
- Tailwind.
- Lucide Icon Pack.
- Zod.
- [Notivue](https://notivuedocs.netlify.app/installation/nuxt.html) was also added to the project.
  - This is not needed, I just wanted another toast library to play with. Feel free to remove it if the built in toast works for you.
- [V-Wave](https://github.com/justintaddei/v-wave).
  - It just adds a ripple effect any component that you want. It's pretty cool. You can remove it if you don't need it.
